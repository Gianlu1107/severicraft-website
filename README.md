## Project

This website was created to best represent the **SeveriCraft** network, an Italian Minecraft server with an active and growing community.  
The main goal was to build a modern, fast, responsive, and easily extendable website.

The work was evenly split between **Gianlu1107** and **Gecko129**, carefully handling every detail: from the HTML/CSS structure to JS logic, SEO optimizations, performance, and accessibility.

## Features

- **Responsive and modular design**: adaptable to all devices, with reusable components and well-organized sections.  
- **Performance optimization**: preloaded images, lazy loading, proper use of `defer`, async loading of external services.  
- **SEO and social ready**: all meta tags optimized for search engines and social media sharing.  
- **Cookie & privacy ready**: integration with Cookiebot for GDPR compliance and consent management.  
- **Smooth user experience**: initial loader, smooth transitions, and feedback for every action.  
- **Dynamic news**: updates loaded via JavaScript, manageable through backend or static JSON files.  
- **Backend-ready integration**: all forms and interactions are designed to easily connect to a dynamic backend (e.g. Flask, Node.js, etc.).
