END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


The SeveriCraft Public License was created to protect both the freedom of users and the authorship of developers who contribute to open-source projects with care, creativity, and responsibility.

By combining the transparency and adaptability of permissive licenses (such as the MIT License) with the strong user protections of copyleft licenses (like the GNU GPL v3), this license ensures that the work remains truly open and that its spirit is preserved over time.

This license is more than just a legal framework — it’s a declaration of principles:
- collaboration over control,
- community over profit,
- and transparency over opacity.

Use it. Modify it. Share it.
But always respect the work behind it.
